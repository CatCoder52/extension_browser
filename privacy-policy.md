# Privacy Policy for Privacy Redirect

**I solemnly swear this extension is up to only good! ðŸ™‚**

All aspects of the extension work locally on your device. With the exception of 
OpenStreetMap (OSM) reverse geocoding, done via the [OSM Nomantim API](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/), 
used as part of OSM redirects, the extension does not connect to any other
third-party web services and it doesnâ€™t collect or transmit 
any information about you, your browsing habits, or your device.

The extension requires access to request data for **all websites** in order 
to intercept requests made to targeted services (Twitter, YouTube, Instagram & 
Google Maps) so that they may be redirected to the appropriate privacy 
respecting alternative, all other requests are ignored.

The extension also requires **local storage** permissions in order to store 
extension specific user preferences and settings.

The extension development is funded through gifts, donations and love.
